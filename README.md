# Library Management System

This is a simple console-based Library Management System built using Java and Maven. It allows adding books, adding members, viewing lists, borrowing and returning books, and searching for books. The project uses a clean structure with models, repositories, and service layers. It runs in the terminal using `java -jar` after packaging with Maven.
